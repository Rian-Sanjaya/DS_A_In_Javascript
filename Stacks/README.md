THE STACK DATA STRUCTURE

- an ordered collection of items that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- addition of new items or removal of existing items takes place at the same end.
- end stack is the top, the opposite side is the base.
- the newest elements are near the top, and the oldest elements are near the base.

THE STACK CLASS

- use an array as the data structure.
- push(element(s)): adds a new item (or several items) to the top of the stack.
- pop(): removes the top item from the stack, also returns the removed element.
- peek(): returns the top element from the stack, does not remove the element, only returns it.
- isEmpty(): returns true if the stack does not contain any elements, and false if the size of the stack is bigger than 0.
- clear(): removes all the elements of the stack.
- size(): returns the number of elements that the stack contains.
